      <p><a class="title" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve-shortening_flow">Curve-shortening flow</a> is the simplest example of a curvature flow. It moves each point on a plane curve \(\gamma\) in the inwards normal direction \(-\nu\) with speed proportional to the signed curvature \(k\) at that point, as described by the equation</p>
      <p>$$ \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial t} = - k \nu.$$</p>
      <p>The name "curve-shortening" comes from the fact that the curve is always moving so as to decrease its length as efficiently as possible. The flow is the lowest-dimensional case of the <em>mean curvature flow</em>: for example, the next case deforms surfaces so as to decrease their area efficiently.</p>
      <p>For any initial curve that does not intersect itself, the flow will converge to a "round point" in finite time - this is the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem.</p>
      <p><b>New:</b> You can make video recordings of this demonstration by following <a href="../csf_record/">this link</a>. Only works in Google Chrome (not mobile friendly).</p>
      <p>The demonstration on this page scales time by a factor of \(1/\max |k|\) for each curve to avoid numerical errors. </p><p>Self-intersecting curves also jump over some cusps that are singularities of the smooth flow - this behaviour is qualitatively (and perhaps quantitatively) the same as that of the weak formulation of the flow. Red markers appear where the curvature is very large.</p>
